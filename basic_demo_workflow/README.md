This is a 'final basic demo workflow' that should have been created by following this Snakemake workshop up to [section 03 - create a basic workflow](https://nesi.github.io/snakemake_workshop/workshop_material/03_create_a_basic_workflow.html). It includes all the files that comprise the **workflow**:

- `./workflow/Snakefile`
 
It also includes all the **outputs** that are produced by running the workflow:

- `./results/`
- `./workflow/logs/`
- `./workflow/slurm-*.out`
- `./workflow/.snakemake/log/`

And the DAG's, filegraphs and rulegraphs we created during this workshop section:

- `./workflow/dag_*.png`
- `./workflow/rulegraph_1.png`
- `./workflow/filegraph_1.png`
