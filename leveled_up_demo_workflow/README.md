This is a 'final leveled up demo workflow' that should have been created by following this Snakemake workshop up to [section 04 - Leveling up your workflow](https://nesi.github.io/snakemake_workshop/workshop_material/04_leveling_up_your_workflow.html). It includes all the files that comprise the **workflow**:

- `./config/`
- `./workflow/Snakefile`
- `./workflow/slurm/`

It also includes all the **outputs** that are produced by running the workflow:

- `./results/`
- `./workflow/logs/`
- `./workflow/.snakemake/log/`
